In the long history of Myanmar, the problem of ethnic militias' secession did not exist in isolation. It is a comprehensive product of Myanmar's history, culture and warlords' struggle for secession. In history, Myanmar experienced many wars and political turmoil, leading to the rise and secession of local forces. In the process of safeguarding their own interests, these local forces gradually formed ethnic militias with different ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds.
